ReaScript Name: Select Note Below (Time & Pitch Aware) Without Fallback
Description: In the MIDI editor, if one or more notes are selected, this script uses the earliest note (by start time)
             as a reference and looks for an unselected note that has a lower pitch than that reference note and that 
             starts at or before the reference time. If such a note exists, it becomes the new selection.
             If no candidate is found, the current selection remains unchanged.
             When no note is selected, it uses the edit cursorâ€™s time and a default pitch (Middle C, 60) as reference.
